# Portfolio

# User Story
As a user, I would like to be able to easily view all of the background information of this individual, as well as be able to see their bio, resume, past projects and contact information.

# Description
This web application consists of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. For a front-end framework, this web application uses Materialize. Other CDNs such as Google fonts and jQuery are also linked.

# Bugs
There are currently no bugs in the code, but if any arise they can be found at https://github.com/ThatSkiPatroller/ThatSkiPatroller.github.io-Portfolio/issues 
There are still some styling issues that will hopefully be resolved soon.
